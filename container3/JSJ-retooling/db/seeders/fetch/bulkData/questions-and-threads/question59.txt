Now in 2015 a new solution is possible with generators defined in ECMAscript 2015 aka ES6.  It was approved in June, but it was implemented in Firefox and Chrome before.  Now a sleep function can be made non-busy, non-blocking and nested inside loops and sub-functions without freezing the browser.  Only pure JavaScript is needed, no libraries or frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>The program below shows how <code>sleep()</code> and <code>runSleepyTask()</code> can be made.  The <code>sleep()</code> function is only a <code>yield</code> statement.  It is so simple that it is actually easier to write the <code>yield</code> statement directly in stead of calling <code>sleep()</code>, but then there would be no sleep-word :-)  The yield returns a time value to the <code>next()</code> method inside <code>wakeup()</code> and waits.  The actual \"sleeping\" is done in <code>wakeup()</code> using the good old <code>setTimeout()</code>.  At callback the the <code>next()</code> method triggers the <code>yield</code> statement to continue, and the \"magic\" of yield is that all the local variables and the whole call-stack around it is still intact.</p>\n\n<p>Functions that use sleep() or yield must be defined as generators.  Easy done by adding an asterix to the keyword <code>function*</code>.  To execute a generator is a bit trickier.  When invoked with the keyword <code>new</code> the generator returns an object that has the <code>next()</code> method, but the body of the generator is not executed (the keyword <code>new</code> is optional and makes no difference).  The <code>next()</code> method triggers execution of the generator body until it encounters a <code>yield</code>.  The wrapper function <code>runSleepyTask()</code> starts up the ping-pong: <code>next()</code> waits for a <code>yield</code>, and <code>yield</code> waits a <code>next()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to invoke a generator is with keyword <code>yield*</code>, here it works like a simple function call, but it also includes the ability to yield back to <code>next()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This is all demonstrated by the example <code>drawTree()</code>.  It draws a tree with leaves on a rotating 3D scene.  A tree is drawn as a trunk with 3 parts at the top in different directions.  Each part is then drawn as another but smaller tree by calling <code>drawTree()</code> recursively after a short sleep.  A very small tree is drawn as only a leaf.</p>\n\n<p>Each leaf has its own life in a separate task started with <code>runSleepyTask()</code>.  It is born, grows, sits, fades, falls and dies in <code>growLeaf()</code>.  The speed is controlled with <code>sleep()</code>.  This demonstrates how easy multitasking can be done.</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"false\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>function* sleep(milliseconds) {yield milliseconds};\r\n\r\nfunction runSleepyTask(task) {\r\n    (function wakeup() {\r\n        var result = task.next();\r\n        if (!result.done) setTimeout(wakeup, result.value);\r\n    })()\r\n}\r\n//////////////// written by Ole Middelboe  /////////////////////////////\r\n\r\npen3D =setup3D();\r\nvar taskObject = new drawTree(pen3D.center, 5);\r\nrunSleepyTask(taskObject);\r\n\r\nfunction* drawTree(root3D, size) {\r\n    if (size &lt; 2) runSleepyTask(new growLeaf(root3D))\r\n    else {\r\n        pen3D.drawTrunk(root3D, size);\r\n        for (var p of [1, 3, 5]) {\r\n            var part3D = new pen3D.Thing;\r\n            root3D.add(part3D);\r\n            part3D.move(size).turn(p).tilt(1-p/20);\r\n            yield* sleep(50);\r\n            yield* drawTree(part3D, (0.7+p/40)*size);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction* growLeaf(stem3D) {\r\n    var leaf3D = pen3D.drawLeaf(stem3D);\r\n    for (var s=0;s++&lt;15;) {yield* sleep(100); leaf3D.scale.multiplyScalar(1.1)}\r\n    yield* sleep( 1000 + 9000*Math.random() );\r\n    for (var c=0;c++&lt;30;) {yield* sleep(200); leaf3D.skin.color.setRGB(c/30, 1-c/40, 0)}\r\n    for (var m=0;m++&lt;90;) {yield* sleep( 50); leaf3D.turn(0.4).tilt(0.3).move(2)}\r\n    leaf3D.visible = false;\r\n}\r\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n\r\nfunction setup3D() {\r\n    var scene, camera, renderer, diretionalLight, pen3D;\r\n\r\n    scene = new THREE.Scene();\r\n    camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, \r\n        window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);\r\n    camera.position.set(0, 15, 20);\r\n    renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ alpha: true, antialias: true });\r\n    renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);\r\n    document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);\r\n    \r\n    directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffaa, 0.7);\r\n    directionalLight.position.set(-1, 2, 1);\r\n    scene.add(directionalLight);\r\n    scene.add(new THREE.AmbientLight(0x9999ff));\r\n      \r\n    (function render() {\r\n        requestAnimationFrame(render);\r\n        // renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );\r\n        scene.rotateY(10/60/60);\r\n        renderer.render(scene, camera);\r\n    })();\r\n    \r\n    window.addEventListener(\r\n        'resize',\r\n        function(){\r\n            renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );\r\n            camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;\r\n            camera.updateProjectionMatrix();\r\n       }, \r\n       false\r\n    );\r\n    \r\n    pen3D = {\r\n        drawTrunk: function(root, size) {\r\n            // root.skin = skin(0.5, 0.3, 0.2);\r\n            root.add(new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.CylinderGeometry(size/12, size/10, size, 16), \r\n                root.skin).translateY(size/2));\r\n            root.add(new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.SphereGeometry(size/12, 16), \r\n                root.skin).translateY(size));\r\n            return root;\r\n        },\r\n        \r\n        drawLeaf: function(stem) {\r\n            stem.skin.color.setRGB(0, 1, 0);\r\n            stem.add(new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.CylinderGeometry(0, 0.02, 0.6), \r\n                stem.skin) .rotateX(0.3).translateY(0.3));\r\n            stem.add(new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.CircleGeometry(0.2), \r\n                stem.skin) .rotateX(0.3).translateY(0.4));\r\n            return stem;\r\n        },\r\n        \r\n        Thing: function() {\r\n            THREE.Object3D.call(this);\r\n            this.skin = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({\r\n                color: new THREE.Color(0.5, 0.3, 0.2),\r\n                vertexColors: THREE.FaceColors,\r\n                side: THREE.DoubleSide\r\n            })\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    pen3D.Thing.prototype = Object.create(THREE.Object3D.prototype);\r\n    pen3D.Thing.prototype.tilt = pen3D.Thing.prototype.rotateX;\r\n    pen3D.Thing.prototype.turn = pen3D.Thing.prototype.rotateY;\r\n    pen3D.Thing.prototype.move = pen3D.Thing.prototype.translateY;\r\n    \r\n    pen3D.center = new pen3D.Thing;\r\n    scene.add(pen3D.center);\r\n    \r\n    return pen3D;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r71/three.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>The 3D stuff is hidden inside setup3D() and is only included to make it less boring than console.log().

Everyone is familiar with the traditional programming style which running the code line by line in synchronised way. SetTimeout uses a callback so the next line does not wait for it to complete. This let me think how to make it \"sync\", so as to make a \"sleep\" function.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning with a simple coroutine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function coroutine() {\n    console.log('coroutine-1:start');\n    sleepFor(3000); //sleep for 3 seconds here\n    console.log('coroutine-2:complete');\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to sleep 3 seconds in the middle but don't want to dominate the whole flow, so the coroutine must be executed by another thread. I consider the <a href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/WaitForSeconds.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unity YieldInstruction</a>, and modify the coroutine in the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function coroutine1() {\n    this.a = 100;\n    console.log('coroutine1-1:start');\n    return sleepFor(3000).yield; // sleep for 3 seconds here\n    console.log('coroutine1-2:complete');\n    this.a++;\n}\n\nvar c1 = new coroutine1();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Declare the sleepFor prototype:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sleepFor = function(ms) {\n    var caller = arguments.callee.caller.toString();\n    var funcArgs = /\\(([\\s\\S]*?)\\)/gi.exec(caller)[1];\n    var args = arguments.callee.caller.arguments;\n    var funcBody = caller.replace(/^[\\s\\S]*?sleepFor[\\s\\S]*?yield;|}[\\s;]*$/g,'');\n    var context = this;\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        new Function(funcArgs, funcBody).apply(context, args);\n    }, ms);\n    return this;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After run the coroutine1 (I tested in IE11 and Chrome49), you will see it sleep 3 seconds between two console statements. It keeps the codes as pretty as the traditional style. The tricky is in sleepFor routine. It reads the caller function body as string and break it into 2 parts. Remove the upper part and create another function by lower part. After waiting for the specified number of milliseconds, it calls the created function by applying the original context and arguments. For the original flow, it will end by \"return\" as usual. For the \"yield\"? It is used for regex matching. It is necessary but no use at all.</p>\n\n<p>It is not 100% perfect at all but it achieves my jobs at least. I have to mention some limitations in using this piece of codes. As the code is being broken into 2 parts, the \"return\" statement must be in outer, instead of in any loop or {}. i.e.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function coroutine3() {\n    this.a = 100;\n    console.log('coroutine3-1:start');\n    if(true) {\n        return sleepFor(3000).yield;\n    } // &lt;- raise exception here\n    console.log('coroutine3-2:complete');\n    this.a++;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above codes must have problem as the close bracket could not exist individually in the created function. Another limitation is all local variables declared by \"var xxx=123\" could not carry to next function. You must use \"this.xxx=123\" to achieve the same thing. If your function has arguments and they got changes, the modified value also could not carry to next function.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function coroutine4(x) { // assume x=abc\n    var z = x;\n    x = 'def';\n    console.log('coroutine4-1:start' + z + x); //z=abc, x=def\n    return sleepFor(3000).yield;\n    console.log('coroutine4-2:' + z + x); //z=undefined, x=abc\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I would introduce another function prototype: waitFor</p>\n\n<pre><code>waitFor = function(check, ms) {\n    var caller = arguments.callee.caller.toString();\n    var funcArgs = /\\(([\\s\\S]*?)\\)/gi.exec(caller)[1];\n    var args = arguments.callee.caller.arguments;\n    var funcBody = caller.replace(/^[\\s\\S]*?waitFor[\\s\\S]*?yield;|}[\\s;]*$/g,'');\n    var context = this;\n    var thread = setInterval(function() {\n        if(check()) {\n            clearInterval(thread);\n            new Function(funcArgs, funcBody).apply(context, args);\n        }\n    }, ms?ms:100);\n    return this;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It waits for \"check\" function until it returns true. It checks the value every 100ms. You can adjust it by passing additional argument. Consider the testing coroutine2:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function coroutine2(c) {\n    /* some codes here */\n    this.a = 1;\n    console.log('coroutine2-1:' + this.a++);\n    return sleepFor(500).yield;\n\n    /* next */\n    console.log('coroutine2-2:' + this.a++);\n    console.log('coroutine2-2:waitFor c.a&gt;100:' + c.a);\n    return waitFor(function() {\n        return c.a&gt;100;\n    }).yield;\n\n    /* the rest of code */\n    console.log('coroutine2-3:' + this.a++);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also in pretty style we love so far. Actually I hate the nested callback. It is easily understood that the coroutine2 will wait for the completion of coroutine1. Interesting? Ok, then run the following codes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.a = 10;\nconsole.log('outer-1:' + this.a++);\nvar c1 = new coroutine1();\nvar c2 = new coroutine2(c1);\nconsole.log('outer-2:' + this.a++);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The output is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>outer-1:10\ncoroutine1-1:start\ncoroutine2-1:1\nouter-2:11\ncoroutine2-2:2\ncoroutine2-2:waitFor c.a&gt;100:100\ncoroutine1-2:complete\ncoroutine2-3:3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Outer is immediately completed after initialised coroutine1 and coroutine2. Then, coroutine1 will wait for 3000ms. Coroutine2 will enter into step 2 after waited for 500ms. After that, it will continue step 3 once it detects the coroutine1.a values > 100.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of that there are 3 contexts to hold variable \"a\". One is outer, which values are 10 and 11.
