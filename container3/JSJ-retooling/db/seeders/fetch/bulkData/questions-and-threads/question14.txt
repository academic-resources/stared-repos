Suppose you want to make an array of functions, <code>adderFunctions</code>, where each function takes a single Number argument and returns the sum of the argument and the function's index in the array. Trying to generate <code>adderFunctions</code> with a loop using the <code>var</code> keyword won't work the way someone might naïvely expect:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// An array of adder functions.\nvar adderFunctions = [];\n\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {\n  // We want the function at index i to add the index to its argument.\n  adderFunctions[i] = function(x) {\n    // What is i bound to here?\n    return x + i;\n  };\n}\n\nvar add12 = adderFunctions[12];\n\n// Uh oh.

Instead, at the end of the loop, the <code>i</code> in each function's closure refers to <code>i</code>'s value at the end of the loop (1000) for every anonymous function in <code>adderFunctions</code>. This isn't what we wanted at all: we now have an array of 1000 different functions in memory with exactly the same behavior. And if we subsequently update the value of <code>i</code>, the mutation will affect all the <code>adderFunctions</code>.</p>\n\n<p>However, we can try again using the <code>let</code> keyword:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Let's try this again.\n// NOTE: We're using another ES6 keyword, const, for values that won't\n// be reassigned. const and let have similar scoping behavior.\nconst adderFunctions = [];\n\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {\n  // NOTE: We're using the newer arrow function syntax this time, but \n  // using the \"function(x) { ...\" syntax from the previous example \n  // here would not change the behavior shown.\n  adderFunctions[i] = x =&gt; x + i;\n}\n\nconst add12 = adderFunctions[12];\n\n// Yay!

Each function now keeps the value of <code>i</code> at the time of the function's creation, and <code>adderFunctions</code> behaves as expected.</p>\n\n<p>Now, image mixing the two behaviors and you'll probably see why it's not recommended to mix the newer <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> with the older <code>var</code> in the same script.

For example (this code is in global scope):</p>\n\n<pre><code>var bar = 5;\nlet foo  = 10;\n\nconsole.log(bar); // logs 5\nconsole.log(foo); // logs 10\n\nconsole.log(window.bar);  \n// logs 5, variable added to window object\n\nconsole.log(window.foo);\n// logs undefined, variable not added to window object\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>When should <code>let</code> be used over <code>var</code>?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Use <code>let</code> over <code>var</code> whenever you can because it is simply scoped more specific. This reduces potential naming conflicts which can occur when dealing with a large number of variables. <code>var</code> can be used when you want a global variable explicitly to be on the <code>window</code> object (always consider carefully if this is really necessary). </p>\n"},{"score":2,"body":"<p>I want to link these keywords to the Execution Context, because the Execution Context is important in all of this. The Execution Context has two phases: a Creation Phase and Execution Phase. In addition, each Execution Context has a Variable Environment and Outer Environment (its Lexical Environment). </p>\n\n<p>During the Creation Phase of an Execution Context, var, let and const will still store its variable in memory with an undefined value in the Variable Environment of the given Execution Context. The difference is in the Execution Phase. If you use reference a variable defined with var before it is assigned a value, it will just be undefined. No exception will be raised. </p>\n\n<p>However, you cannot reference the variable declared with let or const until it is declared. If you try to use it before it is declared, then an exception will be raised during the Execution Phase of the Execution Context. Now the variable will still be in memory, courtesy of the Creation Phase of the Execution Context, but the Engine will not allow you to use it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function a(){\n    b;\n    let b;\n}\na();\n&gt; Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With a variable defined with var, if the Engine cannot find the variable in the current Execution Context's Variable Environment, then it will go up the scope chain (the Outer Environment) and check the Outer Environment's Variable Environment for the variable. If it cannot find it there, it will continue searching the Scope Chain. This is not the case with let and const. </p>\n\n<p>The second feature of let is it introduces block scope. Blocks are defined by curly braces. Examples include function blocks, if blocks, for blocks, etc. When you declare a variable with let inside of a block, the variable is only available inside of the block. In fact, each time the block is run, such as within a for loop, it will create a new variable in memory.</p>\n\n<p>ES6 also introduces the const keyword for declaring variables. const is also block scoped. The difference between let and const is that const variables need to be declared using an initializer, or it will generate an error.</p>\n\n<p>And, finally, when it comes to the Execution Context, variables defined with var will be attached to the 'this' object. In the global Execution Context, that will be the window object in browsers.

This is the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Link</a> Where you Find More Helpful information about <strong>Let</strong> keyword in <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p>\n<p>As per the Definition, the <strong>let</strong> allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope. The other difference between var and let is that the latter is initialized to value only when a parser evaluates it (see below).</p>\n<p>Just like const, the let does not create properties of the window object when declared globally (in the top-most scope).</p>\n<p>As below example:-  let statement declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>\n<pre><code>let x = 1;\n\nif (x === 1) {\n let x = 2;\n\n console.log(x);\n // expected output: 2\n}\n\n  console.log(x);\n  // expected output: 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>Variables declared by <strong>let</strong> have their scope in the block for which they are defined, as well as in any contained sub-blocks. In this way, let work very much like var. <strong>The main difference is that the scope of a var variable is the entire enclosing function:</strong>\nWe can understand it by this example:-</p>\n<pre><code>function varTest() {\n var x = 1;\n {\n  var x = 2;  // same variable!\n  console.log(x);  // 2\n }\n  console.log(x);  // 2\n}\n\nfunction letTest() {\n let x = 1;\n {\n  let x = 2;  // different variable\n  console.log(x);  // 2\n }\n  console.log(x);  // 1\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>At the top level of programs and functions, <strong>let</strong>, unlike <strong>var</strong>, does not create a property on the global object. <strong>For example:</strong></p>\n<pre><code>var x = 'global';\nlet y = 'global';\nconsole.log(this.x); // &quot;global&quot;\nconsole.log(this.y); // undefined\n</code></pre>\n<p>In dealing with constructors it is possible to use the let bindings to share one or more private members without using closures: Example:-</p>\n<pre><code>var Thing;\n {\n      let privateScope = new WeakMap();\n      let counter = 0;\n    \n      Thing = function() {\n        this.someProperty = 'foo';\n        \n        privateScope.set(this, {\n          hidden: ++counter,\n        });\n      };\n    \n      Thing.prototype.showPublic = function() {\n        return this.someProperty;\n      };\n    \n      Thing.prototype.showPrivate = function() {\n        return privateScope.get(this).hidden;\n      };\n    }\n    \n    console.log(typeof privateScope);\n    // &quot;undefined&quot;\n    \n    var thing = new Thing();\n    \n    console.log(thing);\n    // Thing {someProperty: &quot;foo&quot;}\n    \n    thing.showPublic();\n    // &quot;foo&quot;\n    \n    thing.showPrivate();\n    // 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>The same privacy pattern with closures over local variables can be created with var, but those need a function scope (typically an IIFE in the module pattern) instead of just a block scope like in the example above.</p>\n<p><strong>'let'</strong> chosen for block-scoped variable declarations in <strong>JavaScript</strong>? That is undefined in Global Scope.</p>\n<p><strong>JavaScript</strong> has had var from the beginning, so they just needed another keyword, and just borrowed from dozens of other languages that use let already as a traditional keyword as close to var as possible, although in JavaScript let creates block scope local variable instead.</p>\n<p>It does exactly what the <strong>var</strong> does with a scope difference. Now it can not take the name <strong>var</strong> since that is already taken.</p>\n<p>So it looks that it has taken the next best name which has a semantic in an interesting English language construct.</p>\n<pre><code>  let mySon = 'Peter';\n</code></pre>\n<p>In English, it says &quot;Let my Son name is Peter&quot;.</p>\n<p>That's why the <strong>JavaScript</strong> use the let keyword for more flexibility with other language programmers.
