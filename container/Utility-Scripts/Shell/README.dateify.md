##Dateify

Dateify renames files with a preceding date, so they can be sorted easier

For example, the file test.txt created on 2016/10/09 will be renamed to 20161009_test.txt
As the first parameter for the script, a file to be renamed can be specified. If a directory is specified, all child elements of this directory will be dateified. If nothing is specified, dateify will take the current directory.
