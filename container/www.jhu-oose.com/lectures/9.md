# Other Object-Oriented Programming Systems

- Basic principles of object-oriented programming, for example, encapsulation, inheritance, and composition
- How these principles are implemented (or not) in Java and in JavaScript, for example, encapsulation is more difficult in JavaScript
- Prototype-based systems
- Inheritance in other languages
- Monkey patching
- Objects that aren’t from classes
- Traits & mixins
- Stuff from Scala
- Ruby’s singleton classes

# Functional Programming

- Higher-Order Functions
- Immutability
- How React works
- The expression problem
- How functional features are making their way into programming languages that were traditionally object-oriented (not only the features are available, but they’re actually used)
- Idempotence: Like the ItemsRepository constructor

# Other Goofy Paradigms

- Relational Programming: AutoLayout in iOS

# Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)
