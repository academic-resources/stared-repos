# Iteration 5: Even More Features

<small>
As you work on your project in this iteration, you must update the project board that you submitted as a [Roadmap](/iterations/0#roadmap) in Iteration 0 to keep track of your progress.
</small>

<small>
You may need to revise parts of the [Design](/iterations/1#design), and even parts of the [Project Proposal](/iterations/0#project-proposal) as you develop the application. Update the documents as required.
</small>

<small>
Submit the code base for of your application in the root directory of the `master` branch of your group’s repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-group-<identifier>`.

You must implement even more features of your application toward making it usable. Take care to write rigorous tests, document it well, and deploy it. The specifics of what this entails depends a lot on the nature of your project, so you must work with your advisor early in the iteration to establish the goals.

For example, returning to our Yelp for restrooms from [Iteration 4](/iterations/4), you may now implement the social-network component that allows people to follow one another, and take their connections in account when pondering the credibility of restroom reviews, and so forth. The final touches of your application may be left for [Iteration 6](/iterations/6); for example, up to this point your users may be hard-coded into the application, with no mechanism for signup and login.
