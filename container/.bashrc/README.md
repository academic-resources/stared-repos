CUSTOM TERMINAL

### Most of the devs working for technology development are working with command line💻 so as we use it definitely we think of its structure and style which grasps our attention towards work as soon as we open our terminal so I created a bash script to design my terminal which looks cool😎 

### Do you want to style your terminal??🖌

### Then you can refer to my .bashrc file in the repo. If you liked it, smack a star ⭐ to this repo!!😁

### Take a look of my custom cool terminal 😎
