# JavaScript - I

- The point of these assignments is to take your knowledge of JavaScript and start putting into practice the principles learned throughout JavaScript I.

## Set Up The Project With Git

**Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:**

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Add your team lead as collaborator on Github.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

**Follow these steps for completing your project.**

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
- [ ] Add your team lead as a reviewer on the pull-request
- [ ] Your team lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.

## Assignment Description

- Complete all the exercises as described inside each assignment file.
- Use `console.log()` statements to check to see if your code does what it is supposed to do.
- To test your `console.log()` statements open up the index.html file found in the assignments folder and use the developer tools to view the console.

**Note:**You could also run `node /assignments/<fileName>` and see what prints in your terminal.

- Once you finish the exercises in each file, commit your code, and push it to your fork.

### Objects

To better understand objects, you really just need to write more of them. The [objects.js](assignments/objects.js) file contains several challenges centered around a theme of interns starting at a new job. The Human Resources team needs information about the new hires. Use your new found object skills to answer vital questions for HR.

- Read the instructions found within the file carefully to finish the challenges
- Don't work on stretch until you have completed all assignments

### Arrays

The [arrays.js](assignments/arrays.js) assignment takes us through a large data set of used cars. You have been asked to help a used car business with some customer requests based on their inventory. Use for loops and arrays to solve their problems.

- Utilize the the array `inventory` to complete your challenges
- Use any array method you see fit to solve the problem
- Don't work on stretch until you have completed all assignments

### Arrow Function Syntax

- [ ] Arrow Function Syntax - [Check out this awesome guide for ES6 arrow syntax](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/when-and-why-you-should-use-es6-arrow-functions-and-when-you-shouldnt-3d851d7f0b26). You will see more and more arrow functions as you progress deeper into JavaScript. Use the [function-conversion.js](assignments/function-conversion.js) file as a helper challenge to showcase some of the differences between ES5 and ES6 syntax.

### Stretch

- Move on to tomorrow's content and start studying callbacks, write a few of your own to get the hang of it.
- Look at array methods like .map(), .reduce(), .filter(). use them on the data in the arrays assignment to accomplish the same things you did with the ES5 for loop.
