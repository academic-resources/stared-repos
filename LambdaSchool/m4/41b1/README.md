# Node API 2 Guided Project Starter Code

Guided project starter code for **Node API 2** module.

In this project we will learn how to create a very simple Web API using `Node.js` and `Express`, and cover how to use `Express Routers` to break up the application to make it more maintainable.

## Prerequisites

- a REST client like [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) installed.

## Project Setup

- [ ] fork and clone this repository.
- [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned **your fork**.
- [ ] type `npm i` to download dependencies.

Please follow along as the instructor builds the API step by step.

Sending info from client to server:

query string = req.query
url parameters = req.params
body = req.body
headers = req.headers
