# Iteration 6: Full Application

<small>
As you work on your project in this iteration, you must update the project board that you submitted as a [Roadmap](/iterations/0#roadmap) in Iteration 0 to keep track of your progress.
</small>

<small>
You may need to revise parts of the [Design](/iterations/1#design), and even parts of the [Project Proposal](/iterations/0#project-proposal) as you develop the application. Update the documents as required.
</small>

<small>
Submit the code base for of your application in the root directory of the `master` branch of your group’s repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-group-<identifier>`.
</small>

This is the final iteration. Now is the time for the finishing touches that make the application usable. By the end of this iteration, you’ll demonstrate the application in the [Final Presentation](/group-projects#presentations) and it must be at a stage that you could introduce it to real users, or maybe use it to seek investors. The specifics of what this entails depends a lot on the nature of your project, so you must work with your advisor early in the iteration to establish the goals.

For example, returning to our Yelp for restrooms from [Iteration 5](/iterations/5), you may now implement user signup and login, integrations for sharing in social networks, and so forth.
