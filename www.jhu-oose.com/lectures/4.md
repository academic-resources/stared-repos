- [Here’s the code we wrote together in lecture](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/pull/25/commits/46d406a0a4246f77a615e5ae939b4a6de25d2095).
- For this lecture and the next, we’ll implement a new feature in [TODOOSE](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/): the ability to see items that were marked as completed, as opposed to just removing them from the list forever.
- See the [Issue](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/issues/24), its corresponding [Pull Request](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/pull/25), and the [project board](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/projects/3) (look at Iteration 4).
- Some comments on code comments:
  - They’re usually a sign that something could be improved in the code.
  - They have a tendency to get stale.
  - Except for libraries. Code comments that can be turned into developer documentation are essential for libraries.
  - But we’re building applications.
